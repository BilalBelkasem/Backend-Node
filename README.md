# Final Fantasy API 

A Final Fantasy-themed ( once again like last year web advanced xD ) API built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MySQL**, designed for managing game-inspired data such as characters and items.

## Features
- CRUD functionality for characters and items.
- Pagination support for fetching large datasets.
- Designed to emulate a game-style API for educational or gaming projects.

---

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure the following tools are installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- MySQL

---

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository-url> cd final-fantasy-api
### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required Node.js packages:
npm install
### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide your database credentials:
DB_NAME=FF
DB_USER=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_HOST=localhost
PORT=3000

### 4. Set Up the Database
1. Create the database:
   - Open MySQL and create a database named as specified in the `.env` file (`FF`).
2. Import the database schema:
   - Create tables based on database design (see **Data Models** below).

### 5. Start the Server
- For production: npm start
- For development with live reloading: npm run dev
